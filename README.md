# Next.js Project

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It's built with a focus on modern development practices, including TypeScript, React Server Components, and optimized performance.

## Getting Started

First, ensure you have the correct Node.js version specified in `.tool-versions`. Then, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Project Structure

This project follows a modular structure, leveraging Next.js's app router and best practices for organization:

- **`src/app`**: Contains the main application logic, including pages and API routes.
    - `globals.css`: Global styles for the application.
- **`src/components`**: Reusable React components.
    - `layout`: Layout components like `Sidebar`.
    - `task`: Task-related components, such as `task-card`.
- **`src/contexts`**: React context providers (e.g., `auth-context`).
- **`src/middleware.ts`**: Custom middleware for Next.js, handling request interception.
- **Configuration Files**:
    - `postcss.config.mjs`: Configuration for PostCSS.
    - `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.
    - `.tool-versions`: Specifies the required Node.js and potentially other tool versions.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: The React framework for production.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework (assumed, based on common practices).
- **Shadcn UI / Radix UI**: UI component libraries (assumed, based on instructions).
- **TanStack React Query**: For state management and data fetching (assumed, based on instructions).
- **Zod**: For schema validation (assumed, based on instructions).
- **Jest and React Testing Library**: For unit testing (assumed, based on instructions).
- **`next/font`**: Optimizes and loads fonts (specifically Geist in this case).

## Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Utilizes Next.js's SSR capabilities for improved performance and SEO.
- **React Server Components (RSC)**: Leverages RSC to minimize client-side JavaScript.
- **Authentication**: Implements authentication logic (details in `auth-context`).
- **Task Management**: Includes components for managing tasks (details in `task-card`).
- **Responsive Design**: Built with a mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS.
- **Optimized Fonts**: Uses `next/font` for automatic font optimization.
